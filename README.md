Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.
Founded by Colin Hughes in 2001, it provides a platform for individuals to improve their problem-solving and programming skills.

Problem 1: Mutiples of 5 and 3 

    The purpose of this challege is to add all natural numbers less than the input that are multiples of 5 or 3 

    ex: input = 10; 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 23

Problem 2: Even Fibonnacci numbers 

    Add only the postive numbers of the fibannacci sequences 

    ex: 2 + 8 + 34 + 144 = 188
