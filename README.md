Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.
Founded by Colin Hughes in 2001, it provides a platform for individuals to improve their problem-solving and programming skills.

This repository also contains the input and output library 

Problem 1: Mutiples of 5 and 3 

    The purpose of this challege is to add all natural numbers less than the input that are   
    multiples of 5 or 3 
    
    ex: input = 10; 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 23

Problem 2: Even Fibonnacci numbers 

    Add only the postive numbers of the fibannacci sequences 

    ex: 2 + 8 + 34 + 144 = 188
    
Problem 3: Largest Prime Numbers 

    Given a postive number, find the largest prime factor of that number 

    ex: input = 13195; 29 would be the largest prime factor
    
Problem 4 

    A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product     of 2 two-digit numbers is 91 x 99 = 9009 

    the purpose of this problem is to find the largest palindrome frome the product of 2 three     digit numebers

Problem 5
